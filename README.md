## 💡 **Future Enhancements**  
Here are some ideas for improving the app in the future:  
- **Add weather alerts** for extreme conditions (e.g., storm warnings).

## 🛠️ **Troubleshooting**  
> **Issue**: The app is not updating the weather.  
> **Solution**: Ensure you have a stable internet connection. Since it relies on live API calls, the app requires an active connection.  

> **Issue**: The city is not found.  
> **Solution**: Check for spelling errors or try searching for larger metropolitan areas.
